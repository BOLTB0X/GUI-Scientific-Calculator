function varargout = plot2_3D_17013124_project(varargin)
% PLOT_PROJECT MATLAB code for plot_project.fig
%      PLOT_PROJECT, by itself, creates a new PLOT_PROJECT or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = PLOT_PROJECT returns the handle to a new PLOT_PROJECT or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      PLOT_PROJECT('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in PLOT_PROJECT.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      PLOT_PROJECT('Property','Value',...) creates a new PLOT_PROJECT or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before plot_project_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to plot_project_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
